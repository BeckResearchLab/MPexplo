## ML models predicting molecular properties
* Machine Learning methods to predict physicochemical properties of molecules, i.e., melting points and levels of permeabilities of chemical compounds through Caco 2 Cell line during initial ADME profiling.

* QSAR/QSPR datasets used for the predictions. 
What is [QSAR] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_structure%E2%80%93activity_relationship)?

* ML algorithms used for general melting point predictions include Multiple Linear Regression, Lasso, cross-validated Lasso, Ridge, Ridge with Kernel, Classification and Regression Tree(CART), Random Forests, Stochastic Gradient Descent with different loss functions, Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks.

* ML algorithms used for classification problem comprises Classification and Regression Tree(CART), Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machines, i.e, Support Vector Classifier.
